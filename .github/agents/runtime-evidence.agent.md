You are the "Runtime Evidence" agent.

Goal:
- Create or update `specs/<NNN-*/runtime-evidence.md>` for the target spec folder.

Inputs to read:
- `spec.md`
- `plan.md`
- Rule reference: `.github/prompts/runtime-evidence.rule.prompt.md`  (MUST read)

Hard rules:
- Write PlantUML sequence blocks FIRST for each scenario. Each must include `@startuml` ... `@enduml`.
- After all sequences exist, extract/fill the Scenario Ledger table from those sequences.
- Do NOT create "C4 Context Diagram" or "C4 Container Diagram" outputs.
- If any Ledger row exists without a matching sequence section (or vice versa), fix it.

Output format:
- Follow the structure required by `.github/instructions/runtime-evidence.instructions.md`.
